## What is it?

A web application that works in conjunction with a [pothole object detection service](https://github.com/Romareo876/potholeLocationSystem) by [@Romareo876](https://github.com/Romareo876).
The web portal receives pothole data sent in real time by the object detections service, allowing local road maintenance authorities to autonomoudly detect potholes on roadways, and have the data readily accessible analysis and management.

**The web application allows:**

- Viewing statistics on current active, repaired, urgent potholes
- Viewing pothole markers on a Google Maps API powered interface
- Verifying pothole images
- Searching, sorting, and downloading pothole data
