## What is it?

A web application that works in conjunction with a [pothole object detection service](https://github.com/Romareo876/potholeLocationSystem) by [@Romareo876](https://github.com/Romareo876).
The web portal receives pothole data sent in real time by the object detections service, allowing local road maintenance authorities to manage the potholes detected autonomously at greater efficiency.

**The web application allows:**

- Viewing statistics on current active, repaired, urgent potholes
- Viewing pothole markers on a Google Maps API powered interface
- Verifying pothole images
- Searching, sorting, and downloading pothole data
